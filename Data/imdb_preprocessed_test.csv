plot somewhat original actor job pretty well plenty comic relief thing not make lot sense eg first chase scene would heroine not hide somewhere wait baddie leave russian actually speak russian without accent car extremely strange model spanning like year place seems weirdly time overall like thriller probably like one well,1
